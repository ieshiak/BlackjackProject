# Description
The simple Blackjack Java game involves a player and a dealer. Players aim to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it, with face cards worth 10 points and Aces counting as 1 or 11. The dealer reveals cards and follows specific rules for hitting or standing, and the player's goal is to beat the dealer's hand without busting.
# Tech Used
Eclipse, UMLet Eclipse Plugin, Markdown Plugin, Google, Youtube, Github, Terminal, and Sublime Text
# Lessons Learned
Using UMLet in Eclipse was a game-changer for keeping our project organized. UML diagrams made it easy to see how classes were connected and really helped with class hierarchies. But, we hit a snag with a pesky plugin that caused some issues. That got us thinking about checking out other UML tools for our next projects.

We made life simpler by using Enumerations for Suit and Rank when dealing with card attributes. Our Card, Dealing, and Deck classes, which we cooked up in earlier drills and labs, kept our code neat and tidy.

Throwing Blackjack strategies into the mix made things interesting, especially since I didn't know the first thing about playing Blackjack.

We came up with this cool Decisions interface that both Player and Dealer classes use. It made decision-making in the game a breeze, covering everything from hitting and standing to doubling down, splitting, placing bets, and checking the balance.

The Player class took charge of handling the player's hand, balance, and decision-making. Meanwhile, the Dealer class handled the dealer's hand, revealed cards, and made decisions following the game rules.

Dealing with issues from the UML plugin made us reconsider our tools, emphasizing the need to be adaptable during development. We had to tweak and refine things constantly to sort out problems and make the Blackjack game solid.

Sure, we faced some hurdles, but we've got plans to check out different UML tools for a smoother experience. We're also going to keep testing and fine-tuning the game logic to make sure it's top-notch.

In conclusion, creating the Blackjack game in Java was a learning journey. UML diagrams, class structuring, and game logic became second nature. Adding Blackjack strategies and a slick decision-making interface made the game fun and educational. We've got our eyes set on ironing out the kinks, improving the user experience, and fine-tuning the game for future versions.
